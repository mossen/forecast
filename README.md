# Forecast weather

This is a simple SPA that provides a search tool to look for a city and shows the weather forecast for the city.

Demo at [https://mossen-forecast.netlify.app/](https://mossen-forecast.netlify.app/)

## Solution architecture

React.js has been used as the main framework and tailwindcss as CSS framework:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

   As this is an small and not a very complicated application so for the state management the context has been used.

An input field is designed for user to input a keyword to be searched, as a result a list of cities will appear.
By selecting one of the cities from the list the weather forecast for the city will appear on the screen.
